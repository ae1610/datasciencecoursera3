Tidying function first reads all the files from the zip file. This includes the features, subjects and activities list.
For loops are then run to quickly read and calculate the row means for the files in the Test and Train folders.
All of the above variables are column binded so that each row reads the subject, the activity taking place as well as the measurements for the features associated to each instance.
